// Asynchronous Javascript
// Javascript is synchronous and single threaded.
// Synchronous means that code is executed line by line and only one line at a time.
// Single threaded means that only one command can be executed at a time.

// Asynchronous means that multiple things can happen at the same time.
// In the case of Javascript, it means that while some code is being executed, other code can run in the "background".
// This is possible because of the Javascript Engine and the Browser APIs.

// Javascript Engine: V8 Engine (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge)
// Browser APIs: Web APIs (DOM, AJAX, Timeout)

// Javascript Engine
// The Javascript Engine is a program that executes Javascript code.
// It consists of two parts:
// 1. Memory Heap: Where the memory allocation happens.
// 2. Call Stack: Where the code is executed.

// Memory Heap
// Memory allocation happens in the Memory Heap.
// This is where the memory allocation happens.
// This is where the variables are stored and the objects are allocated.
// The memory heap is managed by the Javascript Engine.

// Call Stack
// The call stack is where the code is executed.
// It is a data structure that records where in the program we are.
// It is a stack data structure, which means that the last thing that goes in is the first thing that comes out.
// When a function is called, it is placed on the top of the call stack.
// When the function returns, it is removed from the call stack.
// The call stack is synchronous and single threaded.

//Blocking Code and Non-Blocking Code
// Blocking Code
// Blocking code is code that takes a long time to execute.
// It blocks the execution of the rest of the code.
// It is blocking because it is blocking the call stack.
// It is blocking because it is blocking the single thread.
// It is blocking because it is blocking the execution of the rest of the code.

// Non-Blocking Code
// Non-blocking code is code that does not take a long time to execute.
// It does not block the execution of the rest of the code.
// It is non-blocking because it is not blocking the call stack.
// It is non-blocking because it is not blocking the single thread.
// It is non-blocking because it is not blocking the execution of the rest of the code.

// Browser APIs
// The Browser APIs are APIs that are provided by the browser.
// They are not part of the Javascript language.
